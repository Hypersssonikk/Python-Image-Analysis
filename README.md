# Python Image Pixel Intensities in user defined areas of an image
This script will determine the pixel intensity for red green and blue by summing pixel values in small 
square blocks right across an image.
It also outputs blocks of colour onto an image where the user has defined in the progam ranges of intensity  values 
red green and blue.
I have used modified versions of this script to analyse frames taken from  infrared weather satellite videos on You Tube and have determined water vapour movements across the pacific ocean over a period of one year. This was in an El Nino year and water vapour
increased in concnetration from east to west with the passage of time.
